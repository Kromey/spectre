# Spectral Legacy

Inspired by the [1991 video game Spectre][spectre], this is a simple tank action game I'm creating
to learn to use the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org).

## Controls

 * `W` or `Up` arrow to accelerate; `S` or `Down` arrow to slow/reverse
 * `A`/`D` or `Left`/`Right` arrows or mouse to steer
 * `Spacebar` or `left click` to fire
 * `R` or `right click` to reload (although your tank will reload automatically when you run out of ammo)
 * Mouse scroll wheel zooms the radar in/out
 * `Esc` to quit the game

Your goal is to collect the flags on each level, battling more and more difficult enemies as you progress,
all while the unseen observers in the ominous tower watch. They do not take kindly to acts of rebellion!
